# Neural Appearence based Place model (NAP)
==============================================

This is a dummy package, see [https://github.com/mpkuse/nap](https://github.com/mpkuse/nap). 
It was created to support putting the neural network part (place recognition) on a separate
pysical computer than where the vins-core was running. 


This package is intended to contain: <br/>
a) NapMsg (ros .msg) files<br/>
b) ros launchers (.roslaunch) for entire vins system including the neural network based place recognition part. 
c) rviz configuration files 

The vins-testbed code can be accessed from: [https://github.com/mpkuse/vins-testbed](https://github.com/mpkuse/vins-testbed).
